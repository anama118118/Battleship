//This time, build an interface for you to select the placement of ships. Then, in an unintelligent loop over every value, have the computer "guess" at the squares. The first step of changing the context/mode of the app is the key element here and the computer guessing is just preparation for the human-vs-human version. Work in teams. Divide up work.


import UIKit

class SecondViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
